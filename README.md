# dual_port_RAM
dual port Synchronous RAM with width 8 and depth 16 is designed using verilog HDL. 
Dual-ported RAM (DPRAM) is a type of random-access memory that allows multiple reads or writes to occur at the same time, or nearly the same time, unlike single-ported RAM which allows only one access at a time.

Here the inputs are clock since it is a Synchronous RAM. It has a Synchronous reset.
The depth is 16 so the address bus should be of 4 bits.
The width is 8 so the data and dout should be of 8 bits.
